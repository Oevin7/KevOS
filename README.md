# KevOS
KevOS is my own LFS built from scratch. However, I intend to maintain and make the code free for everyone to use. This is a base project and I am going to update it and figure out what I 100% want to do with it as time goes on. I want to build a privacy respecting, highly customizable Linux OS that anyone is free to use, modify, and redistribute. People are free to contriubute to this project too :) =
This is a learning experience and I can't wait to see where this project goes! It will take a while but it's going to be fun.
